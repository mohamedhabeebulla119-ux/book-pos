/**
 * Root layout for the admin section.
 *
 * The project has no `app/layout.tsx`: `(shop)/layout.tsx` is the storefront's
 * root layout, so admin needs its own root layout in its own route group. The
 * route group name is stripped from the URL, so pages here still resolve to
 * /admin/*, and `/` remains defined inside (shop) as multiple root layouts
 * require.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT included here: AppShell, BottomNavigation, CartProvider and
 * WishlistProvider. The admin panel is a full-width dashboard, not the 480px
 * mobile storefront shell, and it has no cart. This is also why no admin entry
 * can appear in the customer navigation — the two trees share no chrome.
